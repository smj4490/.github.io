## Bootstrap Activity
This was adapted from **Make This In An Hour**
[here](http://makethisinanhour.com).

You will create your own static website hosted on github today, so by the time you are done with this activity you will have something to show for it!

### Instructions
  1. Fork the repository to your account.
  2. Clone the fork to your computer.
  3. Edit the index.html page using the bootstrap [documentation](getbootstrap.com).
    - Some inspirational pieces: [easy](http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0DCP565), [medium](http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB014P16F), and [hard](http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0265951).
    - You don't need to copy everything about these examples, just a general outline to follow
    - If you want to see your changes, use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` on the lab machines (more info can be found in the original article)
  4. Once done playing around and you get what you want, commit the changes.
  5. Next, create your own personal repo called <your-username>.github.io.
  6. Copy the git url for it, and on this repository (cloned on your local machine), run `git remote add personal <git url>`
  7. Next, run `git push personal master`
  8. Now, you should be able to visit your personal site at <your username>.github.io
  9. For submission, make a pull request from the fork (make sure you push changes to origin first!).
